## The narrative is wrong

The common claim is that sponsorship is declining. It's not. Global sponsorship spending continues to grow. What's changing is distribution.

The top 5% of athletes now capture a disproportionate and growing share of total sponsorship dollars. This isn't a new pattern — it mirrors what's happened in media, music, and most attention-driven markets. Winner-take-most dynamics accelerate when measurement improves and budgets consolidate.

## What this means for mid-tier athletes

If you're outside the top tier, the sponsorship economics are getting harder, not easier:

- Fewer deals available per athlete
- More deliverables required per deal (content creation, appearances, social posts)
- Shorter contract terms with tighter performance clauses
- Increasing competition from creators who aren't athletes at all

The cost of earning a sponsorship dollar — measured in time, content output, and brand risk — is rising for most athletes.

## The deliverable inflation problem

Sponsors are getting more sophisticated about what they buy. A logo on a jersey used to be enough. Now, a typical mid-tier sponsorship requires:

- Regular social media posts with brand integration
- Appearance at brand events
- Content creation (video, stories, reels)
- Engagement metrics and reporting

Each of these costs athlete time. The effective hourly rate of sponsorship is dropping for anyone outside the elite tier.

## Alternative revenue rails

This concentration creates an opportunity. Athletes who build owned revenue channels — products, guidance, community — aren't competing for a shrinking pool of sponsorship dollars. They're creating new revenue.

The economics of productised expertise are different from sponsorship:

- Revenue compounds with audience size rather than depending on brand budgets
- Time investment is front-loaded, not ongoing
- The athlete controls the economics, not a brand partner
- Value creation is directly linked to user outcomes, not impressions

## The structural shift

Sponsorship concentration isn't a temporary trend. It's a structural feature of how attention and capital allocate in digital markets. Athletes who recognise this early have a window to build alternative infrastructure before it becomes crowded.

The question isn't whether sponsorship is dying. It's whether your revenue strategy depends entirely on it.
