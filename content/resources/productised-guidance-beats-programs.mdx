## The program era

For the last decade, the default athlete monetisation product has been "the program." A 6-week training plan. A 12-week transformation guide. A PDF or video series that users purchase and follow.

Programs work. They're straightforward to create, easy to price, and simple to deliver. But they have structural limitations that become apparent at scale.

## Where programs fall short

**One-size-fits-all.** A program designed for a general audience can't account for individual starting points, constraints, or progression rates. A beginner and an intermediate follow the same path. This limits both effectiveness and perceived value.

**Front-loaded value.** Users get everything at purchase. There's no structural reason to return after completing (or abandoning) the program. Retention is an afterthought, not a design feature.

**No feedback loop.** Programs don't learn. They can't adapt based on how a user performs, where they struggle, or what they skip. The product stays static while the user's needs evolve.

**Completion rates are low.** Industry data consistently shows that program completion rates hover between 10-25%. This means 75-90% of purchasers don't fully experience the value. That's a product design problem, not a motivation problem.

## The productised guidance model

Productised guidance addresses these limitations:

- **Personalised starting points.** An assessment determines where each user begins. No one starts in the wrong place.
- **Adaptive progression.** The system adjusts based on performance data, constraints, and feedback. The path evolves with the user.
- **Continuous value delivery.** There's always a next step, a next milestone, a next adaptation. The product has no endpoint — it's an ongoing relationship.
- **Built-in feedback.** Every session generates data. Completion rates, pace changes, engagement patterns. This data improves the product for everyone.
- **Retention by design.** Progression mechanics give users structural reasons to stay. They're invested in their own trajectory.

## The economics

Programs are one-time purchases. Average price: $20-100. Customer lifetime value equals purchase price.

Productised guidance supports subscription models. Average price: $15-40/month. Customer lifetime value grows with retention. At 6-month average retention, a $25/month subscription generates $150 per user — with compounding potential from improvements in guidance quality.

## The competitive moat

Programs are easy to copy. A competitor can create a similar PDF in a week. Productised guidance systems accumulate data advantages. Every user interaction makes the system better. Every adaptation improves outcomes. The product gets harder to replicate as it scales.

## The transition

The market is moving from static to adaptive. Users who've experienced AI-personalised recommendations in other domains (music, shopping, content) increasingly expect the same in fitness and skill development.

Programs won't disappear overnight. But the highest-value segment of the market — users who want measurable outcomes and are willing to pay for them — is shifting toward productised guidance.

The question for athletes isn't whether to make this transition. It's when.
